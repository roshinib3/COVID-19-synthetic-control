# What is Synthetic Control?
Methodolgy for causal inference using observational data

This empirical technique was introduced in Abadie A, Diamond A, Hainmueller J (2010). Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies: Estimating the Effect of California's Tobacco Control Program. Journal of the American Statistical Association 105 (490) 493â€“505. In this paper, they explore the causal impact of Prop 99, a California state cigarette tax increase approved in 1988, on cigarette sales. In an ideal world, you could conduct A/B testing (treatment vs control) on a California with and without Prop 99, but we obviously can't do this. Instead, you can create a synthetic version of a California without Prop 99 from a linear combination of untreated control units. The weights of each control unit in the linear combination are created from period pre-treatment, and the actual California and synthetic California are compared post-treatment.
